# Bad Practices ⚠️ #

[![GitHub Build Status](https://github.com/cisagov/bad-practices/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cisagov/bad-practices/actions)

As recent incidents have demonstrated, cyber attacks against critical
infrastructure can have significant impacts on the critical functions of
government and the private sector. All organizations, and particularly those
supporting designated critical infrastructure or [national critical functions
(NCF)](https://www.cisa.gov/national-critical-functions) should implement an
effective cybersecurity program to protect against cyber threats and manage
cyber risk in a manner commensurate with the criticality of those NCFs to
national security, national economic security, and/or national public health and
safety.

CISA is developing a catalog of bad practices that are exceptionally risky,
especially in organizations supporting critical infrastructure or NCFs. The
presence of these bad practices in organizations that support critical
infrastructure or NCFs is exceptionally dangerous and increases risk to our
critical infrastructure, on which we rely for national security, economic
stability, and life, health, and safety of the public. Entries in the catalog
will be listed here as they are added.

1. Use of unsupported (or end-of-life) software in service of critical
   infrastructure and national critical functions is dangerous and significantly
   elevates risk to national security, national economic security, and national
   public health and safety. This dangerous practice is especially egregious in
   internet-accessible technologies.

1. Use of known/fixed/default passwords and credentials in service of critical
   infrastructure and national critical functions is dangerous and significantly
   elevates risk to national security, national economic security, and national
   public health and safety. This dangerous practice is especially egregious in
   internet-accessible technologies.

While these practices are dangerous for critical infrastructure and NCFs, CISA
encourages all organizations to engage in the necessary actions and critical
conversations to address bad practices.

*Note: This list is focused and does not include every possible inadvisable
cybersecurity practice. The lack of inclusion of any particular cybersecurity
practice does not indicate that CISA endorses such a practice or deems such a
practice to present acceptable levels of risk.*
